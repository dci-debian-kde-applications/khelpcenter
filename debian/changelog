khelpcenter (4:5.1.0.1-0ubuntu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  [ Jonathan Riddell ]
  * New upstream beta release

  [ Harald Sitter ]
  * Add lintian overrides
    + Override everything to do with kdeinit5 complaints as it is not
      exactly a properly shared library by design
    + We don't care about missing manpages
    + The desktop file has no main category which is by design as it needs to
      show up prominently in kickoff. It is however onlyshowin=kde, so there
      is tighter control that a desktop entry menu gui implementation actually
      supports this.
  * Make install file more generic to catch future updates to
    applications desktop file and binary name
  * Clean up buld dependencies and remove everything not directly required by
    khelpcenter itself
  * Fix incorrectly bumped breaks and replaces against 5.0.0 -data package
  * Fix khelpcenter4 relationships
    + Drop the Conflicts on khelpcenter4
    + Break and Replace khelpcenter4 << 5.0
    + This change is to stay consistent, previously a Conflicts was used on
      khelpcenter (which was the package name in KDE 3) which in turn caused
      upgrade problems when going from khelpcenter4 to khelpcenter (Frameworks
      5 version) because of being to broad a relationship.
