khelpcenter (4:5.0.95-0ubuntu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  [ Jonathan Riddell ]
  * New upstream beta release

  [ Harald Sitter ]
  * Add lintian overrides
    + Override everything to do with kdeinit5 complaints as it is not
      exactly a properly shared library by design
    + We don't care about missing manpages
    + The desktop file has no main category which is by design as it needs to
      show up prominently in kickoff. It is however onlyshowin=kde, so there
      is tighter control that a desktop entry menu gui implementation actually
      supports this.
  * Make install file more generic to catch future updates to
    applications desktop file and binary name
  * Clean up buld dependencies and remove everything not directly required by
    khelpcenter itself
